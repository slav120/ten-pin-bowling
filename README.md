## TEN PIN BOWLING GAME

Hi, I have created an easy ten-pin bowling scoring game!

There are only two endpoints in this game
1- To start the game
2- To play a frame (please note a frame is 2 rolls)

Keep in mind I've built this very barebones, there are no DBs connected or any fancy features. Just plain and simple.

To begin!

1- Download my Repo
2- npm i to install modules  
3- to run 'npm run dev' in terminal
4- to start a game hit the endpoint "http://localhost:8081/v1/newgame"
5- to play a frame (2 rolls) hit the endpoint "http://localhost:8081/v1/newframe"
6- If you wish to play another one, after your 10 frames just hit the 'newgame' endpoint again
